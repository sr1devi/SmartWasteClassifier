# 🧠 Smart Waste Classifier using CNN

A Deep Learning-based project to classify garbage into categories such as plastic, paper, glass, metal, etc. Developed as part of a **4-week internship program** to explore AI-based solutions for sustainable waste management.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To develop an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that automatically identifies the type of garbage from an image and enables smart waste segregation.
