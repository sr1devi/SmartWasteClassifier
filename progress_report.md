# 🗓️ Week 1 Progress Report - Smart-Waste-Classifier

## ✅ Tasks Completed:
- Downloaded and explored the Trash Type Image Dataset from Kaggle
- Set up Google Colab environment (TensorFlow, OpenCV, Matplotlib)
- Preprocessed image data (resized, normalized, labeled)
- Built and trained a basic CNN model
- Achieved ~85% validation accuracy

## 📊 Results:
- Model trained successfully on 80/20 train-test split
- Dataset pipeline functional and clean

## 🧠 Learnings:
- Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Multi-class classification using softmax
- Label encoding and model evaluation using accuracy

## 🔜 Plans for Week 2:
- Improve model accuracy with data augmentation
- Tune hyperparameters (epochs, learning rate, etc.)
- Explore transfer learning (MobileNetV2 / ResNet50)
- Begin initial testing with Streamlit frontend
